# Ordered Dithering Python Script

Produces an ordered dithering effect for the supplied '.jpg' image. Supplied images must be placed within a './src' folder at the root of this projects directory.

Basic usage:
'python3 main.py --image test.jpg'

The result will be added to a './bin' folder in the current directory.

For more usage help including which optional arguments can be added to adjust the dithering effect, run 'python3 main.py -h'.
